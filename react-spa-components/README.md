# AEM WCM Components - Community Contributions - React SPA core 

These are only for the spa editor since they have a dependency on @adobe/cq-react-editable-components.

Currently supported / exported components:

 - Accordion (V1)
 - Container (V1)
 - Carousel (V1)
 - Tabs (v2)


## Usage
### Importing the whole library: 

```
import * as SpaCoreComponents  from "@adobe/aem-core-components-react-spa";
```

### Importing the button component individually:
 
```
import {AccordionV1}             from "@adobe/aem-core-components-react-spa/dist/container/accordion/v1/AccordionV1";
```
